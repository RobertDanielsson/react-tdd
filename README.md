# Student TDD Practice Application

This application is a simple React and TypeScript project designed to help students practice Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Features

- A Todo List component ([TodoList.tsx](src/Components/TodoList.tsx))
  - An empty React component with tests already written, write the code for the component and watch the tests start to pass
  - Try to implement the code one test at a time
- A Complaint Form component ([ComplaintForm.tsx](src/Components/ComplaintForm.tsx))
  - This component has some logic built in to it along with a couple of tests. Try and fix the failing tests and add more as needed.
- An Email Handler utility ([EmailHandler.ts](src/Utils/EmailHandler.ts))
  - A utility file for handling emails. Finish this up and add additional tests/logic.

Each of these features has corresponding tests in the `__Tests__` directories.
